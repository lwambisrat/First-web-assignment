    <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 140);text-indent: 30px;font-size: 30px;">Hello everyone this is Kenya, <a href="https://akirachix.com/" > AkiraChix</a>.
        I am LWAM BISRAT, student at AkiraChix  code hive program .
        <br> AkiraChix is different.
         what makes it amazing is thier curriculum, rules and regulations. <br>It doesnot have any disturbance, 
        its location is far from the capital city but it looks like resort, it is full of trees and fresh airs.
    </p>

      I am from Ethiopia, Tigray, Mekelle.This is my 3rd week in Kenya and  my first time 
        <br> to live in another place  out of my  country and my family  .
        <br> AkiraChix is big tech-institution and  only girls between age of 18-24 can attend in it . <br>    
           At the first week  , <br>
           it was hard to adapt the situation, the rules and communication with different girls came <br> 
           from dit places but now i am already adapted it and i have many friends from different countries .<br>
           I found  girls from different countries of africa eg;
